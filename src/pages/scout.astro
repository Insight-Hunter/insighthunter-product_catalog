    <p>This tool allows side-by-side comparisons of best, base, and worst-case scenarios focusing on revenue, burn rates, and hiring impacts. It eliminates heavy modelling, providing clear answers for founders making weekly adjustments. Integration with Insight Hunter editions enhances overall financial intelligence.</p>
    <p>Technically, Scout uses lightweight algorithms for fast computations, with export options for sharing with advisors or investors. It is fully mobile-compatible, enabling on-the-go planning.</p>
